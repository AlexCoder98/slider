# slider
Slider created with using TypeScript and CSS3.
You can change slides by using buttons, which are mounted on the both sides of the slide, and by using keys ("Right" and "Left") on keyboard.
By default slides are changing automatically every 5 seconds. After clicking any button or key, slider immediately stops for 5 seconds.
The quotes at the top of the slider are changing simillary to the slides' images.
There is also a date widget at the bottom of the slider, which shows current time and day of the week.
